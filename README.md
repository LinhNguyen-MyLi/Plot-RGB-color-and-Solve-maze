# Solve maze
A labyrinth, or a maze, is defined by a text file with the .map extension. I prepared two such files:<br>
* The first one, maze_0.map, is a small one, just for testing; <br>
* The second one, maze_1.map, is the larger one to test the final code. <br>
These files are just text files. You can open them with Notepad, or any such application and see how they look inside. x: represent for wall, you cannot cross these walls. The starting point is marked with an "s" and the exit point is marked with an "e". There is nothing else in these files. You can create your own files like that.
